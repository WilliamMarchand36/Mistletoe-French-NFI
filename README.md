This repository provides the R script and data that was used in the study "Viscum album in French forests: distribution, environmental drivers and impacts on tree health and growth" by William Marchand, Jean-Baptiste Daubr√©e and Claire Depardieu.
It allows the users to re-draw the main figures.

Mistletoe presence was monitored between 2008 and 2022 on temporary sample plots of the French NFI, along with dendrometric, environmental and ecological data.
We analyzed this data using binomial generalized additive mixed models.

Main findings are:
- The spatial distribution of mistletoe depends on environmental and tree-level factors; 
- Isothermality, temperature and soil factors are key drivers of mistletoe distribution;
- Trees with a high level of canopy dieback are more susceptible to mistletoe infestation;
- Mistletoe induces growth reductions of 22-32 % in Scots pine and Silver fir.
